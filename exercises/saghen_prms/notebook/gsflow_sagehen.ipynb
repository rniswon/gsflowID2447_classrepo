Note that these streams are developed using the model grid scale DEM (DEM_ADJ) rather than the original 10 m DEM. This is an important feature of the scripts because GSFLOW simulates SW-GW interactions using the stream depth and groundwater head. If the streams are generated using the 10 m DEM then streams can be shifted relative to the stream canyons represented by the model grid scale altitudes (90 m DEM). Shifted streams will cause poor convergence, erroneous stream seepage, and excessive spring discharge in cells adjacent to streams. "

By excluding streams, cells containing streams will be filled if they are undeclared swales. CRT fills swales for cells to create downward sloping paths from every cell inside the watershed boundary. Swales are HRUs/cells that are surrounded in all 4 or 8 directions by cells of higher elevation. Streams and stream cells must slope downard in the direction of flow. Non-stream cells can be designated as swales, but caution should be used as no lateral flow can occur out of a swale. Also, note that there cannot be swales for cascades used for routing flow through PRMS groundwater flow reservoirs (GWRs).

CRT can develop cascades as 4-way (cell faces) or 8-way (cell faces and diagonals), and in this case we are using the 8-way option. The assumption is that the watershed slopes are steep enough to assume the water surface slope is equal to land surface slope, which is often a reasonable approximation. Note, this is the same approximation made in the SFR Package. Thus, if there is water stored on the surface or in the gravity storage reservoir of the soil zone then water will be routed according to the directions defined by the cascade paths.\n",

    "### PRMS climate input\n",
    "Daily climate for each grid cell/HRU is required for GSFLOW. A good approach for generating daily climate for each cell/HRU in the model is to rely on climate stations for the daily values (Tmin, Tmax, and PPT). Monthly average spatial adjustment factors are then used to distribute the climate station data to all cells/HRUs. For temperature, either the Temp_1sta or Temp_lapse module is used. For Temp_1sta, temperature adjustment factors by month and cell/HRU are calculated using the monthly PRISM 30-year normals; for Temp_lapse, two climate stations are used to distribute temperatures according to altitude. The latter approach is preferred if there is a low and high altitude station within or near the subbasin. The default approach for the prism_parameters.py script is Temp_1sta, and this can be changed to Temp_lapse in the configuration (.ini) file. Similarly, the Precip_1sta module is default and spatial adjustment factors are calculated using the monthly PRISM 30-year normals.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRMS can read daily climate grids directly, and you may be asking why the dialy PRISM or other gridded climate data is not input directly to the model. The reason is that for basin scale models, the daily climate grids take up huge amounts of disc space, and slow the model significantly to read these data sets for each model time step. Tests have shown that the station-based climate distribution is as good, or better than daily gridded climate products, and there is a 10% or more speed up in model performance.   "
