Repository for Training material
Coupled Ground-Water/Surface-Water Modeling using GSFLOW
ID2447
December 3-6, 2018
USGS New Mexico Water Science Center


## Location
BLM-CA Multi-Use Conference Room, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, CA

## Course Description
Training will cover the procedures for applying GSFLOW to regional-scale basins (<10,000 km2) for water resources management. Topics will include theory and design, construction and calibration, and display and interpretation of model results. Emphasis will be placed on the construction of model input data files using ARC-GIS and python programs that automate data file construction and display of model results. Participants will work collaboratively through hands-on exercises, including discussion of previous instructor-led applications of GSFLOW, and current applications led by class participants. Participants will leave the class with an array of resources for developing GSFLOW models, including software, tutorials, presentations, papers, and web addresses for geospatial and other data resources. 

## Overview
* Monday: Introduction to GSFLOW, overview of PRMS and MODFLOW
* Tuesday: Overview of MODFLOW and class exercizes
* Wednesday: Continue class exercise begin processing results and calibration
* Thursday: Continue processing results and calibration 
* Friday: Class exercise

## Instructors
