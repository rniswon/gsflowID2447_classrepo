Coupled Ground-Water/Surface-Water Modeling using GSFLOW
ID2447
December 3-6, 2018
USGS New Mexico Water Science Center


## Mifi Hotspots


## Location
New Mexico Water Science Center USGS

## Course Description
Training will cover the procedures for applying GSFLOW to regional-scale basins (<10,000 km2) for water resources management. Topics will include theory and design, construction and calibration, and display and interpretation of model results. Emphasis will be placed on the construction of model input data files using ARC-GIS and python programs that automate data file construction and display of model results. Participants will work collaboratively through hands-on exercises, including discussion of previous instructor-led applications of GSFLOW, and current applications led by class participants. Participants will leave the class with an array of resources for developing GSFLOW models, including software, tutorials, presentations, papers, and web addresses for geospatial and other data resources. 

## Overview
* Tuesday: Introduction to GSFLOW, building input files
* Wednesday: Building input data and begin class project
* Thursday: Processing results and calibration
* Friday: Continiue class exercise

## Instructors
* Ayman Alzraiee
* Murphy Gardner
* Steve Markstrom
* Rich Niswonger
* Steve Regan

## Agenda

The following tentative agenda is based on a start time each morning of 8:30 AM and an ending time each day of 4:30 PM.  The agenda may be adjusted during the week in response to student requests.
